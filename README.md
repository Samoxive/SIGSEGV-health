  <p>
    SIGSEGV Health is an Android application made for sports coaches to keep track of their clients/athelets written in Kotlin. This application was made possible by Viita Watches who sponsored "AGÜ Mobile Hackathon 2018" and provided the API used in the application. This project was done with a team of three students who won the hackathon in the first place.
